    <br/>
    My journey began like many others—with curiosity and a passion for learning. As a teenager, discovering coding felt like unlocking a world where I could build anything I imagined. Despite the challenges—errors, bugs, and moments of doubt—I kept pushing forward.

I often questioned if I belonged in this field, but my love for technology and the thrill of creating kept me going. Over time, persistence turned struggles into skills. Now, I can confidently say I belong here. Most importantly, I’ve learned how to learn—a skill that keeps me growing every day.

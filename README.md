**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Designer)`**

I’m a web developer and UI designer, building my version of the digital world step by step. My curiosity for computers led me to web development—a turning point that transformed ideas into reality.

The journey wasn’t easy. I faced challenges, struggled through errors, and kept pushing forward. But with every hurdle, I learned, improved, and refined my craft. Over time, I didn’t just become a developer—I became a problem solver, a creator, and a craftsman.

For me, coding is more than writing logic; it’s about designing experiences, solving real-world problems, and constantly evolving. Learning never stops, and that’s what keeps me moving forward.

    My journey started like many others—with curiosity and a passion for learning. As a teenager, discovering coding felt like unlocking a world where I could build anything I imagined. Despite the challenges—errors, bugs, and moments of doubt—I kept pushing forward.
    I often questioned if I belonged in this field, but my love for technology and the thrill of creating kept me going. Over time, persistence turned struggles into skills. Now, I can confidently say I belong here. Most importantly, I’ve learned how to learn—a skill that keeps me evolving every day.
